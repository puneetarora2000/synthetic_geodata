A Short Tutorial,
Ecologic Corporation, Puneet Arora 



Location-based data plays a vital role in various research fields, including urban planning, transportation, and social network analysis. However, sharing raw location data may raise privacy concerns. 

To address this, researchers often use synthetic geo data, which are realistic yet fabricated location coordinates that mimic real-world patterns.




This tutorial aims to guide researchers on generating synthetic geo data to simulate location-studies for research purposes. We will explore the code listing provided, demonstrate its use cases, and discuss how to save synthetic geo data in different formats such as CSV and JSON.
